# Movie-Recomendation
Imagine In your vacation when you were getting bored and you thought you should watch a movie but don’t know which movie you should watch, you would rather search and find out which are the top rated movies but sometimes you might not like those top rated movies, what would you do then.., ask your friends for some good movies..? That might be a good idea but sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t because your friends might not have the same taste of movies as you

Wouldn’t it be easier if someone tells you a good movie related to or based on movies which you have watched before or liked. Guess what we have made your dream come true
